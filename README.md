# Complex Network Reconstruction via Reservoir Computing

⚠️ WARNING: This project is currently under active development and research. Results and methods are preliminary and subject to change.

## Overview

This research project advances the work of Topal & Eroglu (2023) on reconstructing network dynamics from sparse data. While previous approaches have shown success in specific scenarios, they often fail with extremely limited data or highly complex network structures. We propose a novel method using reservoir computing to overcome these limitations.

## Research Objectives

- Develop a reservoir computing framework for complex network reconstruction that requires minimal time-series data
- Extend reconstruction capabilities to networks where traditional methods fail
- Validate the approach on both synthetic and real-world networks
- Compare performance against existing methodologies
